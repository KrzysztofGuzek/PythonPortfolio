# WaterMark

This is a simple GUI-based **Watermarking Application** built using **Python, Tkinter, and Pillow (PIL)**. It allows users to load an image, add a watermark, and save the modified image.

## Features

- **Load an Image**: Supports PNG and JPEG formats.
- **Preview Image**: Displays the selected image in a Tkinter canvas.
- **Add a Watermark**: Applies a text watermark to the bottom-right corner of the image.
- **Save the Edited Image**: Exports the final image with the watermark.

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

```sh
pip install pillow
```

## How to Run

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Run the script:

```sh
python watermark_app.py
```

## Usage

1. Click **Select Image** to choose an image file.
2. Click **Add Watermark** to overlay the text watermark.
3. Click **Save Image** to export the edited image.

## Technologies Used

- **Python** (for scripting)
- **Tkinter** (for GUI)
- **Pillow (PIL)** (for image processing)

## Future Improvements

- Allow users to customize watermark text.
- Let users choose watermark position and opacity.
- Support image-based watermarks instead of just text.
